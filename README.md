# Spring-boot-DTO-Mapper-And-custom-exceptional-handling

This Spring Boot backend project showcases best practices in API development using **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** and a **Mapper layer** to cleanly separate persistence models from data exposed to clients. It improves maintainability, security, and clarity of the API.

Additionally, the project implements **Custom Exception Handling** using `@ControllerAdvice`, allowing centralized management of errors with meaningful HTTP responses. This ensures consistent error messaging and better debugging for client applications.

✅ Clean architecture using DTOs and mappers  
✅ Centralized and consistent error responses  
✅ Follows RESTful principles  
✅ Ready for scalable enterprise applications
